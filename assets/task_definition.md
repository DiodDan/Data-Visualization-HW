As part of our course on BigData & Data Analysis,
you are tasked with implementing a comprehensive data analysis pipeline.
This assignment will enable you to apply the concepts and techniques we have covered so far,
providing you with practical experience in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling.

# Assignment Objectives:

1. Data Analysis Pipeline Implementation:
    - Load the provided dataset (Global Superstore Orders attached to the assignment).
    - Understand the dataset's structure and key characteristics.
    - Identify and formulate at least four relevant questions that can be answered using the dataset.

2. Data Visualization:
    - Create meaningful visualizations for each of the questions you have formulated.
    - Use various types of charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, etc.) to represent your findings
      effectively.

3. Trend Analysis and Storytelling:
    - Analyse the trends and patterns emerging from the visualizations.
    - Provide insightful explanations and interpretations of the data.
    - Craft a compelling narrative that ties your visualizations and findings together into a cohesive story.

4. Dashboard Creation:
    - Design a sensible and user-friendly dashboard that presents your visualizations and analysis.
    - Ensure the dashboard is intuitive, allowing users to easily understand and interact with the data.

# Deliverables:

1. Data Analysis Report:
    - A detailed report documenting your data cleaning, analysis process, the questions you chose to explore, and the
      visualizations created.
    - Include explanations for each visualization, describing the trends and insights derived from the data.

2. Interactive Dashboard:
    - A fully functional dashboard that showcases your visualizations and allows users to explore the data interactively.
    - Ensure the dashboard is well-organized, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.

# Submission Guidelines:

Report: Submit your data analysis report as a short PDF document.
Dashboard: Provide a link to your interactive dashboard.
